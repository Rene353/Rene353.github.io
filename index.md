### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 , part 2 was a favorite of mine because it involved math and coding together. To be more specific, it involved the quadratic formula and I really enjoyed creating that. It was one of the first things I had ever coded so it was pretty cool that it was successful too.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was a favorite of mine because it was the first guessing game I had created. I really enjoyed seeing that the outcome was successful and worked as I wanted it to work. The game was really fun and it was crazy to think that I had created it. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite of mine because it was a Blackjack game that I had created. I had never played before and in creating this blackjack program, it taught me how to play as well. I was really happy with the outcome of the program.
